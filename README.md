# flight-tracker
When travelling to multiple countries using several airlines it becomes a hassle to keep track of flight details since most airlines use their own apps. 
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 
The application is build in React/Redux with Typescript. It has a Nodejs/Express server, as well as a custom webpack with proxy to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
I plan on integrating a database to allow persistance, weather conditions of destination and a few more ideas. 
I would love to have people contribute to this fun little app.
