# flight-tracker
When travelling to multiple countries using several airline it becomes a hassle to keep track of flight details since most airlines use their own apps. 
I made an app where a user is able to input their flight details and is able to keep all that information in one location. 
The application is build in React/Redux with Typescript. It has a nodejs/express server, as well as a custom webpack with proxy to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
